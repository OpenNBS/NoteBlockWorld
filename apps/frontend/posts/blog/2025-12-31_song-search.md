**That's right:** the (delayed) Christmas present you have been asking for since forever has just arrived! **Song search has been released to everyone in Note Block World, starting now!**

This was simply our most requested feature, and we're glad to finally be able to unveil it to you!

## List of changes

- Added a search bar on the page's navbar!
- The results page includes:
  - Total number of results returned
  - Sorting by recent, popular, duration, play count and note count
  - Ordering (ascending, descending)
  - Many more filtering options coming right next!

We'd like to thank [tomast1337](https://github.com/tomast1337) for a significant portion of the implementation, as well as our Discord community for providing valuable feedback, and even developing some alternatives (such as the **awesome** [Note Block World Finder](https://nbw.flwc.cc/)) to fill in the gap while the official solution wasn't out!

We hope you enjoy the update, and the search feature makes it ever easier to find creations you like on Note Block World!

As always, report bugs to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/note-block-world-608692895179997252) or in our [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenNBS/NoteBlockWorld/issues/new/choose) page. We'd like to make the website the best it can be, and we count on your support to help us achieve this goal!

## Up next

Search is just a small step in our plan to become **the world's largest public, open repository of note block creations.** Although this is a very small feature, some important refactoring is underway to pave the way for even more advanced features:

- In-browser song playback!
- Advanced search filtering!
- User profiles!

You can expect these features to start rolling out in the next few months. Stay tuned — there's much more to come in 2026!

## Wrapping up

This year couldn't have been more amazing. We've reached over **two thousand songs** uploaded to Note Block World, and held our **second community-wide [collaboration event](http://localhost:3000/blog/maestro's-musical-masterpieces)** with the creators of [M.A.E.S.T.R.O.](https://noteblock.world/blog/maestro), which had over **30 submissions** spanning **over 90 minutes of music!** And there was even time for a bonus feature before closing off this year! 🎁

Thank you to everyone who visited the website, shared music with their friends, submitted their own creations, or even [donated](https://opencollective.com/opennbs/donate/profile) to help us keep the website running. **Our community is at the core of everything we do, and the reason why we're excited to keep working on cool things everyday!**

We wish everyone an **incredible 2026**, full of achievements and amazing moments. We'll certainly work hard to make sure it is a wonderful year for Note Block World — especially as it will mark **Note Block Studio's 15th Anniversary!** Stay tuned for the many cool things we're planning to celebrate this remarkable moment in the history of note blocks.

**Happy New Year!** See y'all in the next one! :fireworks: :wave_tone1:
