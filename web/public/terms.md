# Note Block World Terms of Service

> Last updated: July 7, 2024

Welcome to Note Block World! We, at OpenNBS, believe in the power of collaboration, art, and creativity. This platform allows note block musicians to share their creations, discover new works from the community, and enjoy their favorite pieces anywhere they go.

Our core philosophy is that making things out in the open benefits everyone. That’s why, like Open Note Block Studio, this site’s entire source code is available under a permissive license.

These Terms describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our service. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. **By using and submitting content to Note Block World, you agree to these Terms!**

## Agreement

This is an agreement between Note Block World (Us, the Website, and/or the Service) and You (the User). By using and submitting content to Note Block World, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. We have aimed to keep these terms simple and easy to understand.

These Terms are inspired by [Automattic’s Terms of Service](https://wordpress.com/tos/) and are released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license (CC BY-SA 4.0). You may freely use and modify these Terms for your own purposes, provided you credit Note Block World and do not imply any affiliation with us!

### 1. Our Purpose

Note Block World is an online service where you can browse, listen to, and download Note Block Studio song files. Additionally, it allows you to submit your creations to a public database, letting other users discover your music.

### 2. Your Account

To provide the website, we need to collect some data about you and the creations you submit. Please review our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) to understand the data we collect, how we use it, and our commitment to keeping it safe.

### 3. Your Obligations

You must be at least 13 years old to use the website. If you are under 13, you may not use the website without parental supervision.

When participating in activities on the website, such as commenting, sharing, uploading a song, or rating a song, you must strictly follow our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines). Failing to comply with the Guidelines may result in restrictive measures being applied to your account, including, but not limited to: warnings, restrictions, temporary suspension, or full account termination, depending on the severity of the violation(s).

We reserve the right to delete or modify any content you submit to the website, with or without notice, especially if we notice it violates the Community Guidelines. For the purposes of making the website more accessible and user-friendly, we may also make small adjustments to the metadata of your submissions via manual or automated methods, as long as it does not alter the essence of the content. An example is correcting a typo in the title of a song, or adding a missing tag in the metadata.

You agree not to submit illegal material, or any form of adult content, including suggestive content. All content you submit must be suitable for ages 13 and up.

You agree not to exploit mechanisms in ways that may harm the system’s health, integrity, or availability to other users. If you find a security vulnerability, please disclose it to us responsibly via our [security policy page](https://github.com/OpenNBS/NoteBlockWorld/security).

### 4. Copyright

By submitting a song to Note Block World, you assure that it is your original creation and that you possess all necessary rights and clearance to distribute it. **Do not submit content without the proper rights or permission from the original author.**

Certain exceptions can be made under the Fair Use Policy. Fair Use allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holders for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. If you believe your submission qualifies under Fair Use, ensure you understand and comply with the guidelines to avoid copyright infringement.

If you find any content on the website to infringe copyright, you can send a copyright violation report to [opennbs@gmail.com](mailto:opennbs@gmail.com). Copyright violation reports will be promptly investigated. If the report is found to be valid, the infringing content will be promptly removed, and restrictive measures may be applied to the uploader’s account.

Some assets displayed on the website are © Microsoft Studios. For Microsoft’s policies on using these assets, please refer to the [Minecraft Asset Usage Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines). **NOTE BLOCK WORLD AND OPENNBS ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH, OR APPROVED BY MOJANG OR MICROSOFT.**

Unless otherwise specified, all other content belongs to OpenNBS and may not be distributed, copied, or reproduced without our consent.

### 5. License & Usage Rights

By submitting content to the website, you grant Note Block World a permanent, irrevocable, worldwide license to share, distribute, transfer, store, create derivative works of, and display the content and any metadata attached to it. This is necessary for us to distribute your song, generate thumbnails, and ensure the website’s proper functionality. Your content may also be displayed on OpenNBS’s social media pages and other related websites for promotional purposes.

When uploading a song, you may choose to license it under a [Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed) license, allowing anyone to share and adapt your song, provided they give you attribution and retain the same license as the original content. For more information, visit the [Creative Commons website](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/). Once a work is released under a Creative Commons license, you cannot change the license for the material already distributed.

Note Block World will **never** claim ownership of your content. You remain the sole owner of your creations and retain all rights not explicitly granted in these Terms.

### 6. Warranty

Your use of the website comes with no warranty. We cannot ensure uninterrupted functionality or stability of the website, although we will do our best to fix issues promptly. We are not liable for technical issues, data loss, or any other damages that may arise from using the website, nor for the website behaving differently than expected.

We cannot be held responsible in case of data loss, so the website should not be used for permanent, long-term storage of your content. We recommend you keep regular backups of the creations you submit to the website to prevent data loss.

Promotional materials may mention features planned for future updates but not currently available. There is not necessarily a commitment in releasing these features at any specific time in the future.

### 7. Payment

Note Block World is offered free of charge. However, we display ads to cover maintenance, hosting, and distribution costs, according to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

In future versions of the website, we may offer additional features for a fee. Core features like uploading, browsing, and listening to songs will always be free. Payment options, if introduced, will only extend capabilities in cosmetic, non-advantageous ways.

### 8. Replacement

These Terms are the only valid bind between you and Note Block World. Unless otherwise specified, no other documents may substitute or complement these Terms.

### 9. Termination

These Terms may be revoked at any time by either you or Note Block World. If you no longer agree with these Terms and have previously uploaded content, you may terminate your account at any time, which will remove all your content from the website. Deleting your content does not revoke the license you granted us, and we may keep the information you submitted for backup purposes.

### 10. Updates

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time in the future, at our discretion. When an update is made, it will be publicized on this page at least 30 days before taking effect, along with a summary of changes. By continuing to use the website after the new Terms take effect, you agree to the new Terms. Make sure to revisit this page periodically to check for updates!
