# Terms of Service

> Last updated: July 7, 2024

Welcome to Note Block World! We, at OpenNBS, believe in the power of collaboration, art, and creativity. This platform allows note block musicians to share their creations, discover new works from the community, and enjoy their favorite pieces anywhere they go.

Our core philosophy is that making things out in the open benefits everyone. That’s why, like Note Block Studio, this site’s entire source code is available under a permissive license.

These Terms describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our service. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. **By using and submitting content to Note Block World, you agree to these Terms!**

## Agreement

This is an agreement between Note Block World (Us, the Website, and/or the Service) and You (the User). By using and submitting content to Note Block World, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. We have aimed to keep these terms simple and easy to understand.

These Terms are adapted from the [Wordpress Terms of Service](https://wordpress.com/tos/) provided by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), and are released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license (CC BY-SA 4.0). You are free to reuse, adapt and repurpose these terms for your own use, provided you revise the document to reflect your actual practices. We'd also appreciate it if you credit us somewhere in your website!

### 1. Our Purpose

Note Block World is an online service where you can browse, listen to, and download song files created in [Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.org/). Additionally, it allows you to submit your own creations to a public database, letting other users discover your music.

### 2. Your Account

To provide the website, we need to collect some data about you and the creations you submit. Please review our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) to understand the data we collect, how we use it, and our commitment to keeping it safe.

### 3. Your Obligations

You must be at least 13 years old to use the website. If you are under 13, you may not use the website without parental supervision.

When participating in activities on the website, such as commenting, sharing, uploading a song, or rating a song, you must strictly follow our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines). Failing to comply with the Guidelines may result in restrictive measures being applied to your account, including, but not limited to: warnings, restrictions, temporary suspension, or full account termination, depending on the severity of the violation(s).

We reserve the right to delete or modify any content you submit to the website, with or without notice, especially if we notice it violates the Community Guidelines. For the purposes of making the website more accessible and user-friendly, we may also make small adjustments to the metadata of your submissions via manual or automated methods, as long as it does not alter the essence of the content. An example is correcting a typo in the title of a song, or adding a missing tag in the metadata.

You agree not to submit illegal material, or any form of adult content, including suggestive content. All content you submit must be suitable for ages 13 and up.

You agree not to exploit mechanisms in ways that may harm the system’s health, integrity, or availability to other users. If you find a security vulnerability, please disclose it to us responsibly via our [security policy page](https://github.com/OpenNBS/NoteBlockWorld/security).

### 4. Copyright

By submitting a song to Note Block World, you assure that it is your original creation and that you possess all necessary rights to distribute it. **Do not submit content for which you don't have distribution rights, or haven't obtained permission from the original author to distribute!**

Certain exceptions can be made under the Fair Use Policy. Fair Use allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holders for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. If you believe your submission qualifies under Fair Use, ensure you understand and comply with the guidelines to avoid copyright infringement.

If you find any content on the website to infringe copyright, you can send a copyright violation report to [opennbs@gmail.com](mailto:opennbs@gmail.com). Copyright violation reports will be promptly investigated. If the report is found to be valid, the infringing content will be promptly removed, and restrictive measures may be applied to the uploader’s account.

Some assets displayed on the website are © Microsoft Studios. For Microsoft’s policies on using these assets, please refer to the [Minecraft Usage Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines). **NOTE BLOCK WORLD AND OPENNBS ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH, OR APPROVED BY MOJANG OR MICROSOFT.**

Unless otherwise specified, all other content belongs to OpenNBS and may not be distributed, copied, or reproduced without our permission.

### 5. License & Usage Rights

By submitting content to the website, you grant Note Block World a permanent, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive license to share, distribute, transfer, store, create derivative works of, and display the content and any metadata attached to it. This is necessary for us to distribute your song, generate thumbnails, and ensure the website’s proper functionality. Your content may also be displayed on OpenNBS’s social media pages and other related websites for promotional purposes.

We believe open licenses, such as the licenses provided by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), are a powerful way of fostering creativity. That's why, when uploading a song, you may choose to license it under a [Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed) license. This will allow anyone to share and adapt your song, provided they give you attribution and retain the same license as the original content. For more information, visit the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) website. Keep in mind that, once a work is released under a Creative Commons license, you are unable to revoke the license for material already distributed under that license.

All pieces of content you download from the website are owned by their respective authors. This means that, when downloading a song, you must **not** claim it as your own work, or modify, adapt, share, reproduce, reupload or redistribute it, unless the license under which the song was placed allows you to do this. Even then, whenever you use a downloaded song publicly for any purpose other than for your own personal use (for instance, storing and opening it in your computer), you must clearly state that it is not your original creation and credit the original author, preferably providing a link to the song's page in Note Block World. You can find information on how to provide proper attribution in the song's public page.

We will **never** claim ownership of your content! You remain the sole owner of your creations and retain any rights that you may have prior to submitting them to the website.

### 6. Warranty

Your use of the website comes with no warranty. We cannot ensure uninterrupted functionality or stability of the website, although we will do our best to fix issues promptly. We are not liable for technical issues, data loss, or any other damages that may arise from using the website, nor for it behaving differently than you expect.

We cannot be held responsible in case of data loss, so the website should not be used for permanent, long-term storage of your content. We recommend you keep regular backups of the creations you submit to the website.

Promotional materials may mention features planned for future updates but not currently available. There is not necessarily a commitment in releasing these features at any specific time in the future.

### 7. Payment

Note Block World is offered free of charge. However, we display ads to cover maintenance, hosting, and distribution costs, according to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

In future versions of the website, we may offer additional features in return for a financial contribution. We are committed to keeping the website's core features, such as uploading, browsing, and listening to songs, entirely free. Payment options, if introduced, will only extend capabilities in non-advantageous ways, such as unlocking additional customization options, removing ads or increasing certain limits on your account.

### 8. Replacement

These Terms are the only valid bind between you and Note Block World. Unless otherwise specified, no other documents may substitute or complement these Terms.

### 9. Termination

These Terms may be revoked at any time by either you or Note Block World. If you no longer agree with these Terms and have previously uploaded content, you may terminate your account at any time, which will remove all your content from the website. Deleting your content does not revoke the license(s) you granted us when submitting content to the website, and we may keep the information you submitted for backup purposes.

### 10. Updates

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, if the changes are significant, we may post a notice on the main page of our website at least 30 days prior to the changes taking effect. We encourage you to review the Terms regularly to stay informed about updates. Your further use of the website after a change to this document takes effect will be subject to the updated terms.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us at [opennbs@gmail.com](mailto:opennbs@gmail.com)! We are happy to answer your questions and help you understand how they apply to you.
