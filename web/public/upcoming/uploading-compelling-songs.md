Just like in any social platform, the way you present your song can make a big difference in how it's received by the community! If you pay close attention to details when uploading a song, you can make your song stand out and attract more listeners.

Here are some tips on how to upload a compelling song:

## Use other songs as inspiration

Before uploading your song, take some time to listen to other songs on Note Block World. You can find songs in different genres, categories, styles, and levels of complexity. Many of them are open for you to download and freely explore yourself. Having a peek at other musicians' work can be a really valuable opportunity to learn what sounds good about a particular song, and the decisions they took while making it.

## Filling the details

When uploading a song, you'll be asked to fill in some metadata fields, such as the title, description, tags, and thumbnail. These fields are important because they help listeners find your song and understand what it's about. Here are some tips on how to make the best use of the metadata fields to make your song stand out:

### Title

Make sure your **title** is descriptive and catchy. It should give listeners an idea of what to expect from your song:

- If you're uploading an original song, try to come up with a unique title that reflects the mood or theme of the song. For example, _"Dreams of Tomorrow"_ or _"Sunset Serenade"_ are good titles for original songs. You can also use descriptive titles that tell listeners what to expect from the song in terms of genre or mood - for instance, _"Epic Battle Theme"_ or _"Relaxing Piano Melody"_ could be good titles.

- If you're uploading a cover of a song, make sure to include the original song's title in your title, as well as a reference to where it comes from — be it the original artist or a piece of media. For example, _"Sweden - Minecraft: Volume Alpha"_, _"Sweden - Minecraft"_ or _"Sweden - C418"_ are all acceptable titles for the same piece.

- You can use words to describe the genre, mood, or instruments used in the song, but don't overdo it! Keep it simple and to the point.

- Avoid clickbait titles, using all caps or excessive punctuation in your title. Remember, the title should be informative and engaging, not misleading or spammy.

### Description

The **description** is a great way to connect with your listeners! Use this field to provide more context about your song.

- You can describe the mood or feeling of the song in more detail, or talk about the inspiration behind the song, the instruments you used, or any interesting techniques you employed!
- You can also credit co-authors, link to your social media profiles, or even provide a link if you have also uploaded the song to another platform.

The description is a great way to engage with your audience and provide context on the process of making the song, ultimately helping you draw attention from your listeners and build a community around your music!

### Author/Original author

At the moment, it's not possible to change the **author** of a song. It is always set to your public Note Block World username — since you're the one uploading the song, we expect you to have created it... right?!

As for the **original author** field, you can use it to credit the original artist of the song. It is important to give credit where credit is due! So, if you're uploading a cover of a song, make sure to set that field to the original artist's name, be it a single person or a group. This shows respect for the original creators and helps listeners find more songs by the same artist.

On the other hand, if you composed the song yourself, **leave the _Original author_ field blank**. This will automatically credit you as the author of the song in our search results and song pages!

### Category

The **category** field helps listeners find your song by genre. You can choose from a variety of categories, such as _"Classical"_, _"Electronic"_, _"Pop"_, _"Rock"_, _"Gaming"_, and more. Pick the category that best fits your song. This will help listeners find your song when they're browsing songs by their favorite genre!

If none of the available categories fit your song, you can leave this field blank, which defaults to _"No category"_. Just make sure to [let us know](/contact) if you think a new category should be added to the list!

### Tags (coming soon!)

**Tags** are a great way to help listeners find your song! Think about what words someone might use to search for your song, and use those as tags. For example, if your song is a relaxing piano melody, you might use tags like `piano`, `relaxing`, `melody`, `calm`, `peaceful`, etc.

Don't forget to include tags to help listeners find out where the song came from. For instance, a Minecraft cover could have the `Minecraft`, `C418` and `gaming` tags.

Tags can help your song show up in search results and related songs once these features are implemented, so make sure to use them wisely!

### Thumbnail

The **thumbnail** is a small image to be displayed when your song is shown to other users accross the website. It is the very first thing listeners see when they come across your song, so make sure it's eye-catching and relevant to the song!

You can use the **Start Tick** and **Start Layer** sliders to frame an interesting part of the song. You can also increase the **Zoom Level** to increase or decrease the area shown in the thumbnail, according to whether your song is more detailed or more sparse.

Some people even go as far as to create custom pixel art using muted note blocks in Note Block Studio just to use as a thumbnail! Of course, you don't need to go the extra length — but it's a fun way to make your song stand out.

Then, pick a **Background Color**. You can keep the default color (gray), or choose a color that complements the song's mood or theme. For example, a _~ r e l a x i n g ~_ song might have a blue or aqua background, while an epic **BATTLE THEME\*** might have a red or orange background. Think about where the song takes place, or what mood it conveys, and choose a color that fits!

### Custom instruments

If you've used custom instruments in your song, make sure to pick a sound file for each custom instrument you've used. This will make sure that your song sounds the way you intended it to sound, even if the listener doesn't have the custom instruments installed!

This is necessary because Note Block Studio song files carry no information about the custom sound files used in the song. As such, Note Block World can't correlate the custom instruments added to the song with the sound files you've added, since they only exist in your computer. By manually selecting the sound files when uploading the song, we'll do some magic in the background to ensure that your song sounds the way you intended it to sound for everyone who listens to it!

### Visibility

When uploading a song, you can choose whether to make it public or private. Public songs are visible to everyone on Note Block World, while private songs are only visible to you. This lets you decide when to share songs with the community, or to keep them private until you're ready to release them!

### License

Picking a license may seem like a daunting task, but it's actually quite simple! You can choose from two different licenses that determine how others can use your song. Here's a quick rundown of the most common licenses:

- **Standard License**: This license grants Note Block World the right to host and display your song on the website. It also allows other users to listen to your song on the website, but they can't download it or use it in their own projects. This is a good choice if you want to share your song with the community, but retain control over how it's used.

- **Creative Commons - Attribution Share-Alike**: This license grants us (Note Block World) the same permissions as the Standard License. Additionally, it lets other users download it for personal or commercial use in their own projects, as well as create adaptations and modifications, **as long as they give you credit** and **share their work under the same license**. This prevents others from benefitting from your song without giving you credit, or from restricting others from using their work in the same way you've allowed them to use yours.

Using a Creative Commons license can help you reach a wider audience and encourage others to use your song in their own projects, which can lead to more exposure and collaboration opportunities. It's a great way to foster a creative and collaborative environment!

If you have questions about licensing, or if you're not sure which license to choose, feel free to [reach out to us](/contact)! We're here to help you make the best decision for you. You can also learn more about Creative Commons licenses in the [Creative Commons website](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), or check our [help page](/help/uploading-songs) for more info!

## Share your song

Once you've uploaded your song, you can share it with your friends and followers! You can copy the song's URL and share it on social media, forums, or even your own website. You can also use the "Share" button after you upload a song to share it directly on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit.

Sharing your song is a great way to get feedback, build a community around your music, and attract more listeners. Don't be afraid to share your work with others — you never know who might enjoy your song or be inspired by it!

## Conclusion

By following these tips, you can make your song stand out and draw more listeners on Note Block World! Remember, the way you present your song can make a big difference in how it's received by the community. Pay close attention to details when uploading a song, and you'll be well on your way to building a community around your music!
