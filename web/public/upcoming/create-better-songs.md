Everyone's goal when creating music is to make something that sounds good. But when you're just starting, you may often find yourself stuck in a rut, struggling to make your songs sound as good as you'd like them to.

We know what it's like to be in that position. But don't be afraid! Making music is a skill that can be learned and improved over time.

In this guide, we have compiled a list of tips and tricks from the note block community to help you improve your note block songs. While some of these tips are specific to note block music, most of this guide also applies to general music production, and can be applied to any type of music you're making!

Ultimately, our goal is to help you improve your songwriting skills, create more engaging music, and have more fun making music with note blocks!

## What makes a good quality note block song?

This question is entirely subjective. After all, what sounds perfectly good and acceptable to one person might not float another one's boat. And that's totally fine! Different tastes lead to a beautiful diversity in styles, genres and art expressions, that only contributes to make our world and our art richer.

The only person a song should sound good to is yourself — so, start by making songs that you would like and find it enjoyable to listen to, and others will naturally follow!

That being said, there are certain tips you can follow and tricks to keep in mind to have a better chance of having more people enjoy your songs.

### Get inspiration

In [Note Block World](/), you can find hundreds of songs, in different genres, categories, styles, and levels of complexity. Many of them are open for you to download and freely explore yourself. Having a peek at other musicians' work can be a really valuable opportunity of learning what sounds good about a particular song, and the decisions they took while making it.

You can also visit our [Discord community](), where progress in the songs that some artists are working on is shared all the time! You can also send your work-in-progress pieces there and ask for feedback.

### Be aware of the note block limitations

Before starting to make a song, be wary of what medium you want to target; that is, where would you like your song to be played.

Do you want to target vanilla note blocks, so that your song can be built and played in game? If so, then you'll be limited to the 2-octave range supported by Minecraft's note blocks.

Are you less worried with in-game compatibility and just want to write something loosely reminding of the note block feel/(sonoridade)? In Note Block Studio, you're entirely free to place notes outside the 2-octave range, and even use custom instruments to play sounds that aren't available in the vanilla game! (Check out our [custom instruments guide]() to know more.)

And the best option is: if you ever decide to change your mind, it's easy to change course: NBS lets you easily transpose the out-of-range notes so your song is vanilla-compatible again!

### Learn music theory

Most of the music created in the world, especially that made with note blocks, rely a lot on matching simultaneously playing notes (frequencies), what we call a 'chord'. The progression between different chords makes what we call a 'chord progression' and, ultimately, combining different chord progressions leads to an 'arrangement', or a particular set of notes forming the melody of a song.

(To be honest, that's an oversimplification, but many popular songs are structured and written in that way, so it will work well to exemplify this topic.)

This arrangement can be played in different instruments to evoke different tones, emotions or sensations. This variation exists even within a single instrument — for instance, in the piano, you can play notes harder or softer to convey intensity. You can play lower notes to convey something bold and strong, or higher notes for something soft and delicate.

Note blocks, on the other hand, lack quite a lot of this richness. What they lack in instrumentation variety _also_ lacks in pitch range, since each instrument is limited to only 25 unique tones, or two octaves. A large majority of the songs you listen to on a daily basis use notes outside of this supported range, and, as such, can't be represented accurately within the limitations of note blocks. That requires adaptations to be made, depending on whether you want the song to be playable in game or not. And this is not necessarily a bad thing! Limitations spawn creativity, and can lead to surprising outcomes if you learn to use them in your favor.

But when you take rich instrumentations _and_ wide tonal ranges out of the equation, all that's left is what you can create with the simple sounds you have at your disposal. That's why your harmony and melody choices play such a large role in note block music. The chords you choose, the way you arrange them, and the melodies you create are a powerful way to make your note block song stand out.

There's a science to what frequencies sound good together. Learning the theory behind it can help you make better choices when creating your songs. Being aware of this and making conscious musical choices can help you go a long way in creating pleasant tracks!

### Stack multiple instruments

When making a song, you may find yourself trying to capture certain nuances of an existing sound or instrument. But with only 16 instruments available, sometimes it's difficult to find one that's appropriate for the task at hand.

First, try to **listen closely** to each of the available instruments so you grasp the qualities and tones each one has to offer. For example, the guitar is **bold** and **strong**, while the flute is **soft** and **smooth**. Some sounds are more 'percussive', like the xylophone, iron xylophone and cow bell, while others are softer or windier, such as the flute, chime and didgeridoo.

If you learn to recognize these qualities, you can figure out entirely new sounds by combining multiple instruments. And you can play not only with instrument combinations: try stacking different octaves of the same instrument to make your sound feel fuller, the same octave in different instruments to add more tonal qualities or timbres to the sound, or different octaves of different instruments to create multiple voicings – i.e. two instruments playing the same line in an orchestra.

The effects you can create by combining different instruments are endless and really worth exploring if you want to up your note block composition game!

### Don't try to go too overboard

Unless you know _exactly_ what you are doing, the general tip is that **less is more**! If the song you're trying to make is supposed to have complex instrumentation, such as an orchestral song, you may not be able to get it sounding very close to what you expect with just plain note block sounds. Don't let that prevent you from doing it anyway, and don't be disappointed if you aren't able to achieve that from the get-go! A lot of the beauty of note block music is in its simplicity, and the creativity that comes from working within its limitations.

### Practice makes perfection

It may not look like so at the start, but the best way to become better at doing something is to do it over, and over, and over. Each time you create a piece of music is different from all the previous ones! First-hand contact with new experiences and situations will naturally lead you to develop an intuition around what sounds good and what doesn't. This applies to note block music as much as it does for regular music production, and even other fields, such as art and science!

### Share your songs

Don't be afraid to share your work with others! You can share your work on the OpenNBS [Discord server](https://discord.gg/noteblockworld), where you can get feedback from other musicians and enthusiasts. You can also share your work on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, to reach a wider audience and get more feedback - there are even specific subreddits and forums dedicated to posting your music! Send your songs to your friends, family, or anyone else who might be interested in listening to them. This will let people know about your work and help you get more exposure.

### Ask for feedback

When sharing your song, don't be afraid to _actively_ ask for feedback from those who listen to it. Feedback is a valuable tool for improving your skills and growing as a musician! A fresh pair of ears can help you identify areas where you can improve, and give you new ideas and perspectives you may not have thought of before. You can learn a lot from the feedback you receive, and it can immensely help you improve your skills and grow as a musician!

### Have fun!

Fiddle around! Throw stuff away, and start again! The most important thing is to have fun while making music. Don't stress too much about making the perfect song, and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. The more you enjoy the process of making music, the more you'll learn and grow as a musician. After all, the only commitment you have is with yourself!

## Conclusion

Making note block music is a fun and rewarding experience that can help you develop your **creativity and musical skills**. By following the tips and tricks outlined in this guide, you can create better quality note block songs that you and others will enjoy.

Remember to **get inspiration** from other musicians, try to learn **music theory** if you can, play with **stacking instruments**, and **practice regularly** to improve your skills. Don't be afraid to **share your work** with others and **ask for feedback** to help you grow as a musician. Most importantly, **have fun** and enjoy the process of making music!
