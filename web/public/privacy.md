# Note Block World Privacy Policy

> Last updated: July 7, 2024

Welcome to Note Block World! Although we strive to collect as little data as possible, we need to collect some information about your usage of the website in order to allow it to work, provide you with a personalized experience, and improve our service.

This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect, the purposes for which we use it, and how we handle it. Our purpose is to make it clear how your data is used and stored, giving you full control over what information you share with us and how it is used in the context of the website.

This document is inspired by the [Automattic Privacy Policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/) and is available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license (CC BY-SA 4.0). You are free to reuse, adapt and repurpose these terms for your own use, provided you revise the document to reflect your actual practices. We'd also appreciate it if you credit us somewhere in your website!

## Data Treatment

### What Data We Collect

We only collect information from you if we have a legitimate reason to do so. For example, to provide our service, to communicate with you, or to improve our website. The data collected by us may be collected automatically when you visit our website, come from you directly, or be provided by third-party services you use to sign in.

When you visit our website, we may store the following data automatically for logging purposes:

- Browser information
- Language preference
- Approximate location
- Websites that referred you to our website
- Device model and category
- Hardware and software information
- Actions performed on the website (e.g., viewing or downloading a song, clicking on a link)

If you choose to sign in using an account provider, we collect additional data, which is provided to us by the service you use to sign in. You will be prompted to authorize the collection of this data when signing in with an authentication provider. This includes:

Your email address is used only for identification in our systems and will not be publicly disclosed. The initial part of your email (before the @) may be used to generate a unique username if your provider does not supply one. You cannot change this username at this time. If you prefer this information not be publicly disclosed, please sign in with a different provider!

Your profile picture and display name will make up your public profile on the website and will be publicly visible. Currently, you cannot change this information on our website; instead, update your profile in the service you used to sign in if you wish to change your public profile.
