Hi, fellow note block enthusiasts!

We're still working hard on improving your experience with Note Block World. For this update, we've focused on improving the website's usability and adding more content to help you get started with making note block songs.

Here's what we've been up to since the last update:

### New features

- Added a Help Center! It contains five articles on using the basic features of Note Block Studio and Note Block World.
- Added a blog! It will host everything about the website, from change logs on major updates, and technical writing on some of the development aspects of the website, to tips on how to make your note block songs better!
  - The idea is to host guest writers from the community once in a while, so stay tuned!
- Added the _About_ page! We're proud of our history and want to share it with you. We also want to acknowledge all the great people that have made this website possible, and everyone who's helped us along the way. Make sure to drop by and read about how Note Block World came to be!
- The navigation bar at the top has been redesigned:

  - Now features _Songs_, _Help_, _Blog_, and _About_ tabs.
  - The _Upload_ icon is no longer shown on mobile devices.
  - The external links (_GitHub_, _Changelog_, and _Donate_) have been moved from inside your user menu into a 'Settings' menu, so they're now accessible even if you aren't logged in.
  - There's now a _Contact_ page accessible from within the new Settings menu.

- Added more mob sounds to the available custom instruments:
  - Polar Bear
  - Phantom
  - Evoker
  - Warden
  - All previously missing Ghast sounds such as `affectionate_scream`

### Bugfixes and improvements

- Fixed a rounding error in the BPM field of songs that could display it with maaaaaany trailing zeroes.
- Added a custom 404 (Not Found) page. (Why is that listed here?! You'll see... üòè)
- Fixed songs uploaded between 28-29 days ago being shown as uploaded '0 months ago'. (Who knew, it's over four weeks but less than a month!)

## What's next?

For our next update, we'll focus on ironing out the last few critical bugs and improving the website's usability, so we'll be as close as ever to our official launch! Our goal is to make Note Block World available to the general public by **the end of the year** - but it may be available even sooner if everything goes smoothly!

As always, we're open to feedback and suggestions. If you find any bug, or have any ideas on how to improve the website, please let us know on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8Y3v4bJ) or by using the shiny new [Contact](/contact) page!
