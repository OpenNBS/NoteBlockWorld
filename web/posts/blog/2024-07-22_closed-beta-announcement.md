Hello everyone! After over eight months of intensive development work, we're happy to announce that Note Block World is now on a **closed beta** stage! üéâ

As the first step towards the official launch, we're opening the website to a limited number of users to test the platform and provide feedback. This is a crucial stage to ensure everything is working as expected and to fix any bugs that may arise.

Initially, members with one of the **Note Block Expert**, **Community Contributor** and **Supporter** roles in our Discord server have been given access. If you're not in one of these roles, please be patient! We'll be gradually adding more users as we progress through the beta stage. Alternatively, you can support us with any amount on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/opennbs/donate) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/OpenNBS) to get access right away!

This stage will last a couple weeks, so we can iron out any major bugs before the official launch. The beta will be unlocked to the general server in the following stage.

## What to keep in mind

- Make sure to test everything as thoroughly as you can! If you find any issues, feedback or improvement suggestions, let us know via our Discord server or our [contact](/contact) page.

- In order for the 'Open in NBS' button to work, you must have installed one of the latest **3.11 beta versions**. You can download them from the [NBS GitHub releases page](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio/releases), or by enabling the option _'Check for development versions'_ in the app's preferences.

- At this time, all the songs you upload will be **public** and everyone will be able to download them. You'll be able to disable allowing downloads in the future, in case you wouldn't like your songs to be downloaded by other users.

- **This is an early version**: for now, only basic features such as uploading, downloading and browsing songs are available. We understand this feature set as the bare minimum that can provide value to the community, so we decided to deliver an early version as soon as we had these features ready ‚Äî this lets us get as much feedback as possible early on and improve the platform as we go!

Keep in mind this is a barebones version and many, many features are planned for future releases! We're also launching a [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/OpenNBS/projects/4) to track all the features we want to build in upcoming versions, so make sure to check it out to see what's coming ahead.

We sincerely hope you enjoy the website! üòÅüé∂üåé
