Our closed beta program is a huge success! In just over five days, y'all have uploaded dozens of songs, and reported lots of bugs that we didn't manage to find in over six months of testing(!) Thank you so much for your engagement and feedback!

We're happy to announce that most of the issues you brought to our attention have been fixed. Some other issues are still being worked on, but we'll be working on them over the next few weeks. Keep reading for the list of changes in this update!

## Fixed issues

- **Main page:** Song time may display as 2:60
- **Main page:** Last row is duplicated when loading more songs
- **Thumbnail:** Key labels of notes in the thumbnail are 9 semitones off
- **Thumbnail:** Pling and xylophone appear exactly the same due to a 'color' filter being applied
- **Thumbnail:** Guitar notes colored blue instead of brown
- **Thumbnail:** Notes now match their appearance in NBS more closely
- **Song page:** 'Category' field displaying in lowercase
- **Upload:** 'Original author' field doesn't show an error message when character limit is exceeded
- **Upload:** Max song size increased to 3 MB (up from 1 MB)
- **Upload:** Instrument dropdown selector now works properly

NB: existing thumbnails aren't updated automatically! You can regenerate the thumbnail by editing the song.

### Known issues

As we've mentioned above, some known issues still remain in this update. Here's a list of the most important ones:

- **General:** Your session expires too often, causing you to be logged out or uploads to fail with an 'Unknown error'. This will be fixed in the next few weeks!
- **General**: You can't access private songs even if you are the uploader
- **Song page**: long fields may be truncated in the right info panel, so you may not be able to read the full text
- **Song download**: Notes that exceed A0 or C8 (via pitch changes) sound different when opening vs. downloading the song

We're working hard to fix these issues as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience! If you find any other issues, please let them known in our Discord server or in our [contact page](/contact).

Thanks for your support and feedback on this early stage of Note Block World! We're excited to keep improving the website until our official launch, and we're glad to have you along for the ride. Happy note-blocking! ðŸŽµ
