Note Block World was made for note block musicians to easily share and discover new music they like. Our goal is to provide a platform where note block songs can be shared as openly as possible, to allow everyone to enjoy them, learn from them and foster creativity in the community!

One of the main features of Note Block World is the ability to listen to and download songs created by the community. When you find a song you like, you can download it to listen to it in Minecraft or edit it in Note Block Studio. This guide will walk you through the process of downloading songs from Note Block World, so you can enjoy your favorite music wherever you go!

## Listening to songs

As Note Block World is still in an early phase, we don't offer a built-in player yet. In order to listen to a song, you'll need to download it and open it in Note Block Studio. (We're working on adding a player to the website so you can listen to any song directly on your browser! Stay tuned to our [blog](/blog) for updates.)

In the meantime, here's how you can listen to songs from Note Block World:

1. **Find a song you like**: Browse the [home page](/) to discover featured and recent songs.

2. **Head to the song's page**: Click anywhere on the song's card to view its details. Here, you'll find more information about the song, such as the title, description, author, tags, and more.

3. **Open the song in Note Block Studio**: We have made a handy button that will automagically launch Note Block Studio and open the song for you! Make sure you have **at least version 3.11** of [Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.com) installed on your computer, and click the _Open in NBS_ button in the song's page.

4. You should see a prompt asking you to open the file with Note Block Studio. Confirm you want to launch it to load the song in Note Block Studio.

5. Once the song is downloaded in Note Block Studio, you can listen to it as much as you want!
