**Note Block World** is the largest public community centered around Minecraft note blocks, developed by the same folks who brought you [Note Block Studio](https://noteblock.studio/). It lets you discover, share and listen to note block music more easily than ever!

## History

After maintaining Note Block Studio for over four years, we noticed one of the community's most frequent requests was for a place to share and browse note block music created with the app: there simply wasn't any good one!

The idea for a song-sharing social website was baking in our minds for over four years, but only started to take shape around late 2023, as we gained experience in web development and started to grasp its viability. After a few months of planning plus a whole year in development, it finally came into reality. We're hugely proud to bring Note Block World to you!

With openness as one of our core premises and as a way to give back to our incredible community, we're happy to make this website's entire source code [publicly available](https://github.com/OpenNBS/NoteBlockWorld)!
